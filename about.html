        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>Deliverance church international Kaplong was started in1990 with four adults as pioneer
          members under the
          leadership of Bishop Dr. Philip Ngetich who was then serving as the lay pastor to the church. He was also
          teaching in a nearby primary school as an employee of Teachers Service Commission. He had a compelling call to
          serve God and he therefore led the establishment of the church. At inception, members conducted Sunday
          services
          at Chepkosiom primary school. In 1997, the church leadership decided to buy a half of an acre piece of land at
          Kaplong which is the current location of the church. The church ground was not immediately used for worship
          due
          to limited resources to build the church. At the time, economic situation of the country was unstable and most
          people lived in shortage. It was the time you could find the government providing relief food to almost every
          part of the country during dry spell. With such a situation, it was not possible to make significant progress
          even in church.</p>

      <div class="column">
        <h1> </h1>
        <p>
          The church pastor and other leaders, despite such shortcomings, held their heads high and continued serving
          God
          and hoping that things would change and the house of God would one day grow to unimaginable proportions. That
          dream would start happening in 2002 when the church shifted to the church plot though unplanned. It was not
          planned because members woke up one day and they were told that the room they were using was no longer
          available
          and were required of them to look for another place. They indeed had to shift to an open church plot where
          they
          had to use a makeshift tent. Unknown to many members, that shift became the turning point for the church. The
          first foundation stone was laid around the same time leading to the construction of one of the best
          sanctuaries
          in the region. That was followed with the construction of the Sunday school sanctuary, extension of the church
          plot, fencing, construction of kitchen and acquisition of kitchen ware and equipment.

          The Grace of God upon the church has indeed multiplied in many ways leading to church growth. God has
          continued
          touching the hearts of men in the church through the senior pastor who has labored faithfully in teaching the
          Gospel of Jesus Christ. The leadership of the senior pastor has been recognized by the national leadership of
          the church and he was therefore ordained as a Reverend and later a Bishop. All these responsibilities are a
          testament to the centrality of the church in the affairs of not only its catchment area but also in the
          national
          agenda of the church.

      <p>The church is located in Kenya, Rift Valley, Bomet county, Kaplong trading centre along Kaplong-Bomet highway.
        The area is barely cool and wet with most residents practicing livestock and crop farming as their main
        economic
        activities. A few people rely on small business as their source of livelihood. The church is also surrounded
        by
        learning institutions such as Kaplong Boys’ secondary school, Kaplong Girls’ National school among others. In
        the neighborhood also is St. Clares Kaplong Hospital. This kind of environment leads to a potential catchment
        area for church membership.</p>
